## Bringing Personalization to Facial Expression Recognition

<!-- ## Progressive Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (P-MSDA) -->

**Based on our publication in \*IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing**

## 🔍 Problem Overview

Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) traditionally assumes using **all
available subjects** as sources improves performance.

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/publications/pmsda_fig_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

**Figure 1 (a)** illustrates:

- Large **domain gaps** between many source subjects and the target.
- Combining all sources introduces **noise and negative transfer**.
- Misaligned subjects confuse the model rather than helping it adapt.

> **Many source subjects lie far from the target in feature space ---
> hurting adaptation.**

This motivates our approach **Figure 1 (b)**:
⚡ Start with the most similar subjects → gradually introduce more
challenging ones.

## 💡 Our Proposed Method: Progressive MSDA (P-MSDA)

Our method consists of two major components:

---

## 1️⃣ **Source Selection Using Similarity Ranking**

We compute cosine similarity between the target subject and each source
subject.\
Sources are then ranked **from closest → farthest**.

This process is illustrated below:

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/publications/pmsda_fig_3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Demonstrated how the model identifies subjects with the most similar expression distributions and facial structures, selecting them as the initial steps in the adaptation process.

These closest subjects form the basis for our curriculum:

- Step 1 → adapt to the _closest_ subject
- Step 2 → adapt to the second closest
- ...
- Step _n_ → adapt to more diverse subjects

This progression greatly reduces early domain shift.

## 2️⃣ **Progressive Domain Adaptation Pipeline**

The complete workflow of **P-MSDA**:

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/publications/pmsda_fig_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Key components:

#### ✔ Progressive Curriculum

Subjects are introduced one at a time (easy → hard).

#### ✔ Density-Based Replay Memory

At each stage, representative samples are stored based on cluster
density --- preventing forgetting.

#### ✔ Multi-domain Alignment

Using MMD-based discrepancy loss, the model aligns:

- Current source
- Replay samples
- Target domain

This ensures stable learning at every stage.

## 📈 Results Across Benchmark Datasets

Our approach outperforms all MSDA and UDA baselines on:

- **BioVid (Heat Pain database)**
- **UNBC-McMaster**
- **Aff-Wild2**
- **Behavioural Ambivalence/Hesitancy (BAH) dataset**

Highlights:

- **BioVid:** 88% accuracy
- **UNBC-McMaster:** 0.88 accuracy
- **Aff-Wild2:** 0.46
- **BAH:** 0.71
- **Cross-Dataset (UNBC → BioVid):** 0.78

## 🎯 Why Progressive Learning Works

Ablations confirm:

- Random subject ordering performs significantly worse
- Density-based replay selection boosts stability
- Progressive alignment yields compact target-specific clusters
- Training efficiency stays high (only 3 domains used at once)

---

## ✨ Takeaway

P-MSDA enables robust, label-free personalization for FER systems:

- 🚀 Personalized FER **without labeled target data**
- 🔄 Scalable multi-source adaptation
- ❌ Avoids negative transfer
- 🏆 Achieves state-of-the-art results
