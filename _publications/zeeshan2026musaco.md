## Leveraging Multimodality for Personalized Expression Recognition

**Published in WACV 2026: IEEE Winter Conf. on Applications of Computer Vision**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔍 Problem Overview

Personalized expression recognition (ER) involves adapting machine learning models to subject-specific data to improve recognition of expressions with considerable inter-personal variability. While Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) can improve robustness by treating subjects as domains, current state-of-the-art methods often overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain. This limits subject diversity and fails to explicitly capture unique subject-specific characteristics.

**Figure 1** compares different approaches:

 - (a) Unimodal MSDA: Aligns sources within a single modality, which often reduces accuracy.

 - (b) Multimodal UDA (Blending): Blends sources into a single domain, failing to exploit subject-specific diversity.

 - (c) MuSACo (Ours): Selects relevant sources per modality using co-training and aligns them using both class-aware and class-agnostic losses.

**Existing methods often fail to generalize for subtle expressions and across diverse individuals due to variations in cultural and individual expressiveness.**

## 💡 Our Proposed Method: MuSACo

We introduce **MuSACo**, a Multimodal Subject-Specific Selection and Adaptation method based on Co-Training. It leverages complementary information across modalities (e.g., visual and physiological) and selects relevant source subjects for adaptation.

The method consists of three key stages

---

## 1️⃣ **Source Selection via Co-Training**

To address the challenge of leveraging multiple source subjects, MuSACo selects sources most relevant to the target.

* We estimate similarity scores between source and target subjects using embeddings from each modality.
* Using a co-training strategy, sources that produce high similarity scores in either modality are selected.
* A threshold is applied to filter out less relevant sources, ensuring only the most informative subjects are used.

---

## 2️⃣ **Dual-Loss Domain Alignment**

MuSACo employs a robust alignment process using target Pseudo-Labels (PLs):

#### ✔ Generating Target Pseudo-Labels (PLs)
PLs are generated by selecting predictions from the dominant modality (e.g., visual or physiological) based on probability scores. This ensures diversity in feature representations.

#### ✔ Class-Aware & Class-Agnostic Alignment
* **Class-Aware Loss:** We use confident target samples (selected via threshold) to minimize distribution mismatch through class-aware alignment.
* **Class-Agnostic Loss:** To utilize useful but less confident samples (which are often discarded), we introduce a class-agnostic loss that aligns non-confident target samples with the source.

---

## 3️⃣ **Disentanglement & Fusion**

To improve generalization:

**Disentanglement:** We use an entropy-based estimator (KNIFE) to disentangle identity-related information from expression-specific features.

**Modality Alignment:** Features from different modalities are concatenated for each selected source and confident target subject, then processed through a fusion module.

## 📈 Results

We evaluated MuSACo on three multimodal datasets: **BioVid** (pain), **StressID** (stress), and **BAH** (ambivalence/hesitancy).

**Key Findings:**

* **BioVid:** MuSACo achieved **43.8% Avg Acc**, outperforming Unimodal MSDA (34.7%) and Blended UDA (36.3%).
* **StressID:** Achieved an overall gain of **15.6%** over the lower bound and consistently outperformed state-of-the-art MSDA methods.
* **BAH:** In uncontrolled, real-world settings, MuSACo surpassed all baselines, achieving **69.9% Average Acc**.

> **MuSACo consistently outperforms UDA (blending) and state-of-the-art MSDA methods on challenging multimodal data.**

## ✨ Takeaway

MuSACo supports personalized modeling by adapting to each target subject through relevant sources. This makes it particularly relevant for digital health applications, such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain.
