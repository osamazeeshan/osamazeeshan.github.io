### Summer School

#### Faculty Attestation

I had the opportunity to serve as a faculty member for the 2023 Summer School on AI and Behavioural Health, held from July 3–7, 2023. Hosted by the FRQS Double Chair in Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health for Health Behaviour Change in collaboration with Concordia University and ÉTS, this intensive week-long program provided a valuable learning experience while also allowing me to contribute through lecture delivery and participation in teaching activities.

#### Teaching Attestation

I was grateful to gain hands-on experience in AI and behavioural intervention, learning alongside a talented group of participants during the 2023 Summer School on AI and Behavioural Health. The program highlighted how AI can support and enhance behavioural health interventions, and I was delighted to lead a motivated group throughout the week—facilitating collaboration, discussion, and shared learning.

#### 🎥 Guest Lecture: Deep Learning

I delivered a video lecture on Deep Learning, covering foundational concepts, model architectures, and practical applications. The session introduced students to core ideas in neural networks, representation learning, and modern DL pipelines, with an emphasis on real-world deployment and problem-solving.
