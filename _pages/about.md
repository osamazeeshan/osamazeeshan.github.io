ðŸ‘€ <strong>Hello there! Thank you for visiting my page.</strong> 

Iâ€™m a <em>Developer, Consultant, ML Researcher, and ðŸ“š Doctorate Student. </em> with 9+ years of experience working in the industry and research institute. My research interest focused on developing real-time, robust applications by blending computer vision and deep learning techniques. Specifically, I worked on the imagery data by extracting, localizing, and recognizing patterns/objects/content from the videosâ€™. 

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am pursing Ph.D. on <em>Adaptation of Deep Learning Models for Video-Based Expression Recognition</em> under the supervision of Prof. Eric Granger and Prof. Marco Pedersoli.
