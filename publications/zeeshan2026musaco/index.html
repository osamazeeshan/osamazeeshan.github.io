While Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) can improve robustness by treating subjects as domains, current state-of-the-art methods often overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain. This limits subject diversity and fails to explicitly capture unique subject-specific characteristics.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publications/musaco_motiv-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publications/musaco_motiv-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publications/musaco_motiv-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/publications/musaco_motiv.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p><strong>Figure 1</strong> compares different approaches:</p> <p><strong>(a) Unimodal MSDA:</strong> Aligns sources within a single modality, which often reduces accuracy. <strong>(b) Multimodal UDA (Blending):</strong> Blends sources into a single domain, failing to exploit subject-specific diversity. <strong>(c) MuSACO (Ours):</strong> Selects relevant sources per modality using co-training and aligns them using both class-aware and class-agnostic losses.</p> <p><strong>Existing methods often fail to generalize for subtle expressions and across diverse individuals due to variations in cultural and individual expressiveness.</strong></p> <hr> <h2 id="-our-proposed-method-musaco">💡 Our Proposed Method: MuSACO</h2> <p>We introduce <strong>MuSACO</strong>, a Multimodal Subject-Specific Selection and Adaptation method based on Co-Training.
