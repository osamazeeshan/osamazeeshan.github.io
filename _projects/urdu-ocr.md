Developed a custom Urdu OCR pipeline using OpenCV and Tesseract, achieving 88% accuracy in detecting/recognizing Urdu text from low-resolution news videos. Built a content-based video indexing system (Python, TensorFlow) for news archives, reducing search time by 60% across 10,000+ hours of footage. Leveraged keyframe extraction and metadata tagging to enable semantic querying of video content.
